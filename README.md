# Flight Controller

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-cyan?style=flat-square&logo=arduino&logoColor=cyan)](https://github.com/AbdoullahBougataya/Flight_controller/.github/workflows/main.yml)

> [!TIP]
> This codebase is compatible with the Arduino UNO board

## Overview

This repository is the software part of a DIY flight controller. It's for people who want to build their own flight controller. This project is based on what we've learned (and what we're still learning) as Control & Automation engineering students. **The software has features for flight stabilization, sensor integration, PID control, and signal processing**. Compatible with quadcopter drones.

## Features

- Real-time flight stabilization using **PID control**.
- Supports the **BMI160 IMU** (**I**nertial **M**easurement **U**nit) sensor.
- Supports the **BMP280 Barometric sensor** (Altimeter).
- Communication via **standard RC protocols** (PPM/PWM).
- Simple sensor communications **using I²C**.
- Integration with **GPS** (**G**eo**p**ositioning **S**ervice) modules for navigation.
- Cross-platform compatibility with **Arduino language** compatible boards (UNO, MEGA, ESP32, Teensy...).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flight Controller software.

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Required hardware:
  - Microcontroller (e.g., [Arduino UNO](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3), [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3)...)
  - [BMI160](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi160/) IMU
  - [BMP280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/pressure-sensors-bmp280.html) Barometric sensor
  - GPS module (optional)
  - RC transmitter and receiver

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdoullahBougataya/Flight_controller.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and upload the code to your microcontroller.

## Hardware Configuration

_Waiting for the image_

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware components as per the [Hardware Configuration](#Hardware-Configuration).
2. Power on the flight controller and **wait 5 seconds** for the sensors to calibrate.
3. Use your RC transmitter to control the drone.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your *feature* or *bugfix*.
3. **Submit a pull request** with a detailed description of your changes.
